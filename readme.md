# WHAT DOES THE BOT DO?

Tired of pinging some role when you add a tag to a thread? Use the bot and whenever a tag is added to forum, the bot fetches the role with that name and pings it.

## Video tutorial

Wanna see how bot works actually? Watch the video on my [Twitter]() or [Linkedin]() or [Facebook]().

## Installation

Refer to my general guide on how to run the bot [here](https://github.com/bilal-the-dev/How-to-run-my-discord-bots)

If you still face any problem, please open a issue.
